## BestGC++

BestGC++ is a profiling tool aiming to select the best Garbage Collector for a given application. It does so by benchmarking
your application, retrieving metrics used to score the Garbage Collectors with respect to execution time and GC pause time.
Although, previous Garbage Collection Scores are needed. Check the tool [BenchmarkGC](https://github.com/guilhas07/benchmark-gc) to compute them.
